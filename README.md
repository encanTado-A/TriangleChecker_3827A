# Detail: 
## Write a Java program that fulfils the following requirements
The program should able to accept three integers representing the three sides of a triangle. Based 
on the input values, the program should able to determine whether the triangle is:
- Equilateral triangle - all sides with the same length; or
- Isosceles triangle - two sides with the same length; or 
- Scalene triangle - all sides are with different lengths; or 
- Right angled triangle – one of the angles is 90 degrees.

  For examples, 
  - If the input values are 10, 10, and 10, the program should indicate that the input values will 
  form an “Equilateral triangle”. 
  - If the input values are 4, 3, and 5, the program should indicate that the input values will form 
  a “Right angled triangle”.
